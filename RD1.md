I was supposed to learn how to use dictionaries and lists in programming. First we used the
function that Professor. Z gave us in class, then the rest was pretty simple. We just had to use for loops for the translations
were correct and that it would then output on the file. Our results do match
and the error checking works correctly. The biggest challenge I encountered was trying to
get the program to ask 2 different 'enter file name' statements, so i made it in the first one.
First we designed our program, then wrote the program, then tested it to see if it worked
I think I learned what i was supposed to in this lab, and working with owen was nice.
